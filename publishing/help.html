             <h2><a name="Overview">Overview</a></h2>
             <p>The Registry Publishing Wizard is a form interface for publishing <a href="http://www.ivoa.net/Documents/latest/RM.html" target="_blank">VO Resources</a> 
             to the <a href="http://usvao.org" target="_blank">VAO</a> registry at the Space Telescope Science Institute.
             A VO Resource is a collection of metadata describing an astronomical data service, a web page for astronomical research, 
             or even an institution that publishes astronomical data. By defining a resource and publishing it to a registry, users of many VO 
             search websites and VO-enabled tools will be able to find and access your data, cross-correlate it with other VO-accessible data, and 
             cite it using the metadata you provide. The registry at STScI is part of a global network of registries called the <a href="http://ivoa.net" target="_blank">International Virtual
             Observatory Alliance</a>'s Registry of Registries, and resources published to it will be mirrored throughout the IVOA.</p>

             <h2><a name="AccountsAndLoggingIn">Accounts and Logging In</a></h2>
             <p>Access to the STScI registry publishing system is available for anyone with astronomical data to share with the IVOA community, not only
             STScI or other US Virtual Observatory affiliates. Accounts as set up by individuals at institutions already known to the IVOA registry network
             can be created from the main login page for the publishing wizard. If a user from a new institution not listed in the drop-down presented at 
             user registration would like to share their data in registry resources, a resource for the institution ("authority" in VO Resource parlance)
             must first be created, and then the user may register as associated with that authority. If you would like to register services or other
             resources but cannot find your institution listed, use the <a href="http://www.usvao.org/contact-connect/" target="_blank">US VAO Contact page</a> 
             for support.</p>
             <p>If you had an account with the previous STScI xforms-based publishing interface, your login information and resources belonging
             to you have been preserved. If you need your account information sent to you, or you would like to have your resources transferred to a new account, 
             please use the same <a href="http://www.usvao.org/contact-connect/" target="_blank">Contact page</a>.
             Currently, all user account information is kept locally at STScI in a database with passwords encrypted. We hope to move our system to a VAO-wide 
             Single Sign-On system already in operation at NRAO and NCSA in a later version.</p>

             <h2><a name="ManagingYourResources">Managing Your Resources</a></h2>
             <p>When logged into an account, the main management page provides a summary of your currently active resources. From here, you have the option 
             to create new resources in the form interface from scratch or by cloning an existing resource, edit your existing resources, or delete them.
             Resource deletion does not remove the resource from 
             the underlying registry, but marks it as 'deleted' for mirroring in the IVOA registry network and removes it from search results and VO tools. 
             Creating a new resource offers a a choice of various resource types, and a blank form tailored to the information relevant for each. Required fields
             are marked with an asterisk (*). Any non-required fields left blank will not be included in the published resource, but can be added later through the 
             same form interface. Editing an existing resource will populate a set of forms with the currently supplied information, which can be edited field by field, and
             new information can be added. The only field that cannot be edited after original creation is the unique IVO identifier. Cloning an existing resource will populate 
             forms for a new resource using all of the information from an existing one except the identifier. This option allows a user to easily create multiple similar resources
             with a minimum of typing. We also intend to release a file upload option, for those users who feel comfortable 
             directly editing resource XML documents</p>
             <p>Resources may be un-deleted by contacting <a href="http://www.usvao.org/contact-connect/" target="_blank">US VAO help</a>; direct interface support for management of 
             deleted and other inactive resources will be provided in a later version.</p>

             <h2><a name="ResourceTypes">Resource Types</a></h2>
             <p>There are several basic types of resources one can publish to the IVOA registries. These are standard VO data services which directly provide 
             astronomical data in IVOA-specified formats, non-standard data services including web services and form-based web pages, and generic support resources 
             like the authority records for institutions, which assist registry owners and users in understanding the data and metadata provenance for  
             those web pages and services. When you create a new resource, you will be asked which of these general types of resources you intend to create. 
             This determines the extended information you can enter about a given resource, particularly for well-defined standard service types.
             </p>
             <p>Basic services supported by this form interface include Cone Search, Simple Image Access, and Simple Spectral Access services. All of the required 
             and the most common optional information for registering each of these types of services is available through the form interface. Currently
             only one of each type of service capability (ConeSearch, SIA, or SSA) can be specified within a single resource (though multiple service endpoints within that capability are allowed), 
             with optional non-standard web service and descriptive web page capabilities also optionally defined. TAP services will be supported as soon as possible. </p>
             <p>Non-standard services allow users with astronomical data not available through a valid Cone Search, SIA, or SSA service to still publish their data 
             for IVOA tools and search web pages to use. This includes RESTful and SOAP-based web services, and form-based web pages for data access. Multiple 
             non-standard interfaces can be defined within a single resource.</p>
             <p>Generic resources without data attached, such as the ones describing institutions themselves can also be defined using the form interface. It is very 
             rare for a user to publish resources of this type.</p>

             <h2><a name="GlossaryOfIndividualFields">Glossary of Individual Fields</a></h2>
             <p>Within the main publishing form, we have attempted to offer inline help for most individual fields that can be entered as part of a resource's 
             metadata description via pop-up quicktips. The complete list is reproduced here for accessibility, with additional information about required fields and
             the use of controlled vocabularies and curation-related linking through drop-downs. Almost all of this documentation comes directly from the IVOA standards
             documents describing generic resources, data services, and individual standard service types, including comments in the XML schema documents.</p>

             <h3><a name="FieldsForAllResourceTypes">Fields for All Resource Types</a></h3>
             <p><b>Title</b>: Required. Freetext title for the resource. Typically, a Title will be a name by which the resource is formally known. Title should be an unabbreviated form (e.g., Hubble ACS Archive Images) rather than an acronym unless the acronym is so well known as to be part of standard usage.  Publishers are encouraged, but not required, to define unique Titles. Ex: "Hubble ACS Archive Images"'</p>
             <p><b>Short Name</b>: Required. 16-character shorthand title for the resource. 'The ShortName will be used where brief annotations for the resource name 
                                  are desired, such as in GUIs that might refer to many resources in a compact display.  
                                  ShortName strings are limited to a maximum of sixteen characters.  Care should be 
                                  taken to define illuminating ShortNames indicating either where the resource comes  
                                  from or what data collection it provides.  ShortNames are not required to be unique.  
                                  A resource provider may use the same ShortName for several related resources 
                                  (e.g., different services that access the same collection), or the same ShortName might 
                                  be used by different providers for common/mirrored resources.  In the latter case, the 
                                  ShortName defined by the original publisher of the resource should have preference. EX: "HST.HDF_SOUTH" </p>
            <p><b>Identifier</b>: Required, must be unique. An unambiguous URI-style reference to the resource.  The 
                                  syntax for Identifiers maintains that they must begin with the identifier of an institution already
                                  itself described in the Registry. Append resource-specific tags to this prefix; do not edit it. Ex: ivo://archive.stsci.edu/ssap/stis</p>
            <p><b>Description</b>: Required. Description may include but is not limited to: an abstract, table of contents, 
                                   reference to a graphical representation of content or a free-text account of the content. 
                                   Thorough text descriptions are particularly encouraged in order to make text-based 
                                   searches against the registries maximally useful.  Description should emphasize what 
                                   the resource is about, as other matters such as who created it, when it was created, and 
                                   where it is located are described elsewhere in the resource metadata.</p>
            <p><b>Publisher</b>: The person or organization registering a service (organization preferred.)   
                    Users of the resource should include Publisher in subsequent credits and acknowledgments.
                    The Publisher field is chosen from a drop-down including all of the authority resources known to the registry, 
                    which allows for better data linking and curation. For old resources that do not have a link to an existing
                    authority resource, a freetext field is supplied, as some curation information is better than none.</p>
            <p><b>Curation/Version</b>:This version number is a label associated with the creation or availability (i.e., most recent release or version) of the resource. This is not necessarily the same as the version number for any service interface.</p>
            <p><b>Creator</b>: The organisation or individuals responsible for the intellectual   
                               content of the resource, as opposed to the organisation or individuals who may have developed   
                               the service by which the content is made available.  Guidelines:  1) If the resource is a   
                               data collection or service accessing a collection, then Creator fields should list the scientists responsible for the original data collection. Typically, this would be list of authors   
                               associated with the defining published paper for the collection. At a minimum, the PI or   
                               lead author should be given. Full names should be given, not just surnames. 2) For a   
                               collection that is a compilation of many separately published collections (e.g., an archive), then the Creator should be set to "various".  3) If the resource is an organisation   
                               not associated with a specific collection, the most appropriate value is either empty or   
                               the name of the person responsible to assembling the organisation. Often, an empty   
                               value is most appropriate. 4) If the resource is a Registry that publishes records for a   
                               single organisation, the Creator may contain the person(s) responsible for collecting or   
                               creating the metadata held in its records. Otherwise, it can be an empty value.  5) If the   
                               resource is an Authority, it should contain the name of the person that reserved the   
                               authority ID it records.  Users of the   
                               resource should include Creator in subsequent credits and acknowledgments. Multiple entries are allowed for this field.</p>
             <p><b>Creator Logo</b>: A URL pointing to a graphical logo, which may be used to help identify the information resource. This will be displayed in some generated web pages summarizing the resource, if provided. 
                               There is no hard size limit on the image as only the URL is kept in the resource, but keep in mind that it will most often be displayed at a thumbnail size by registry clients.</p>
             <p><b>Contact (General)</b>: Information that can be used for contacting someone with regard to this resource. Multiple entries are allowed for this field.</p>
             <p><b>Contact Name</b>: The name of the contact. This can either be a personal name, "John P. Jones", or a group, "Archive Support Team".</p>

            <p><b>Max File Size</b>: The size of the largest file the service will return, in bytes.</p>
            <p><b>Image Service Type</b>: Required. The category of Image Service that this services falls into. Image Service Type is chosen from a drop-down representing a controlled vocabulary. Options are as follows: 
                        <ul><li>Cutout: This is a service which extracts or "cuts out" rectangular regions of some larger image, returning an image of the requested size to the client. Such images are usually drawn from a database or a collection of survey images that cover some large portion of the sky. To be considered a cutout service, the returned image should closely approximate (or at least not exceed) the size of the requested region; however, a cutout service will not normally resample (rescale or reproject) the pixel data. A cutout service may mosaic image segments to cover a large region but is still considered a cutout service if it does not resample the data. Image cutout services are fast and avoid image degredation due to resampling. 
                        </li><li>Mosaic: This service is similar to the image cutout service but adds the capability to compute an image of the size, scale, and projection specified by the client. Mosaic services include services which resample and reproject existing image data, as well as services which generate pixels from some more fundamental dataset, e.g., a high energy event list or a radio astronomy measurement set. Image mosaics can be expensive to generate for large regions but they make it easier for the client to overlay image data from different sources. Image mosaicing services which resample already pixelated data will degrade the data slightly, unlike the simpler cutout service which returns the data unchanged. 
                        </li><li>Atlas: This service is similar to the image cutout service but adds the capability to compute an image of the size, scale, and projection specified by the client. Mosaic services include services which resample and reproject existing image data, as well as services which generate pixels from some more fundamental dataset, e.g., a high energy event list or a radio astronomy measurement set. Image mosaics can be expensive to generate for large regions but they make it easier for the client to overlay image data from different sources. Image mosaicing services which resample already pixelated data will degrade the data slightly, unlike the simpler cutout service which returns the data unchanged. 
                        </li><li>Pointed: This category of service provides access to collections of images of many small, "pointed" regions of the sky. "Pointed" images normally focus on specific sources in the sky as opposed to being part of a sky survey. This type of service usually applies to instrumental archives from observatories with guest observer programs (e.g., the HST archive) and other general purpose image archives (e.g., the ADIL). If a service provides access to both survey and pointed images, then it should be considered a Pointed Image Archive for the purposes of this specification; if a differentiation between the types of data is desired the pointed and survey data collections should be registered as separate image services.
                        </li></ul></p>

            <p><b>Test Query Position (RA)</b>: For a test query wherein your service will return a non-empty response: a right-ascension in the ICRS coordinate system for the position of the field center, given in decimal degrees.  If a positional/size test query is defined at all, both positional values and at least one size dimension should be provided. </p>
            <p><b>Test Query Position (Dec)</b>: For a test query wherein your service will return a non-empty response: a declination in the ICRS coordinate system for the position of the field center, given in decimal degrees.

            <p><b>Test Query Size (Latitude/RA)</b>: For a test query wherein your service will return a non-empty response: The coordinate angular size of the region's RA given in decimal degrees. A special case is SIZE=0. For an atlas or pointed image archive this tests whether the given point is in any image. For a valid POS/SIZE test query, both positional values and at least one size dimension should be provided. </p>

            <p><b>Data Creation Type</b>: Required. The category that describes the process used by the service to produce the dataset. Typically this describes only the processing 
                                        performed by the data service, but it could describe some additional earlier processing as well, e.g., if data returned by the service is partially precomputed from the source data.
                                        Data creation type is chosen from a drop-down representing a controlled vocabulary. Options are:</p>
                                        <ul><li>Archival: The entire archival or project dataset (e.g., file) is returned. Transformations such as metadata or data model mediation or format conversions may take place, but the _content_ of the dataset is not substantially modified (e.g., all the data is returned and the sample values are not modified).
                                        </li><li>Cutout: The dataset is subsetted in some region of parameter space to produce a subset dataset. Sample values are not modified, e.g., cutouts could be recombined to reconstitute the original dataset.
                                        </li><li>Filtered: The data is filtered in some fashion to exclude portions of the dataset, e.g., passing only data in selected regions along a measurement axis, or processing the data in a way which recomputes the sample values, e.g., via interpolation or flux transformation. Filtering is often combined with other forms of processing, e.g., projection.
                                        </li><li>Mosaic: Data from multiple non- or partially-overlapping datasets are combined to produce a new dataset. Mosaic data may or may not employ filtering, i.e., computation of new data samples. If filtering is not involved data samples are assumed to be produced by "cutting out" regions of the mosaiced datasets.
                                        </li><li>Projection: Data is geometrically warped or dimensionally reduced by projecting along the axis of a multidimensional dataset.
                                        </li><li>Spectral Extraction: Extraction of a spectrum from another dataset, e.g., extraction of a spectrum from a spectral data cube through a simulated aperture.
                                        </li><li>Catalog Extraction: Extraction of a catalog of some form from another dataset, e.g., extraction of a source catalog from an image, or extraction of a line list catalog from a spectrum (generally not valid for a SSA service).

                                   Data Source is chosen from a drop-down representing a controlled vocabulary. Options include:
                                   <ul><li>Survey: A survey dataset, which typically covers some region of observational parameter space in a uniform fashion, with typically with complete coverage within the region of parameter space observed.
                                   </li><li>Pointed: A pointed observation of a particular astronomical object or field. Typically, these are instrumental observations taken as part of some PI observing program. The data quality and characteristics may be variable, but the observations of a particular object or field may be more extensive than for a survey.
                                   </li><li>Custom: Data which has been custom processed, e.g., as part of a specific research project.
                                   </li><li>Theory: Theory data, or any data generated from a theoretical model, for example a synthetic spectrum.
                                   </li><li>Artificial: Artificial or simulated data. This is similar to theory data but need not be based on a physical model, and is often used for testing purposes.
                                   </li></ul></p>
            <p><b>Max Records</b>: The largest number of records (entries) that the query operation will return in a single response, as an integer.</p>
            <p><b>Default Max Records</b>:  The largest number of records that the service will return when the MAXREC parameter not specified in the query input. If not specified the default maximum number of records in a query response is undefined.</p>
            <p><b>Max Aperture</b>: Only relevant for services with Data Creation Type of "Spectral Extraction". The largest aperture diameter, in degrees, that can be supported upon request via the APERTURE input parameter by a service that supports the special extraction creation method.  A value of 360 (the default) or an empty field means there is no fixed limit.</p>
            <p><b>Max File Size</b>: The estimated maximum output dataset file size in kilobytes. (Some older services have this listed in bytes.)</p>
            <p><b>Max Search Radius</b>: The largest search radius, given in decimal degrees, that will be accepted by the service without returning an error condition. A value of 180.0 or an empty field indicates that there is no restriction.</p>
            <p><b>Test Query (POS Longitude/RA)</b>: For a test query wherein your service will return a non-empty response: The longitude (e.g. Right Ascension) of the center of the search position specified in decimal degrees. If a positional/size test query is defined at all, both POS values should be provided. </p>
            <p><b>Test Query (POS Latitude/Dec)</b>: For a test query wherein your service will return a non-empty response: The latitude (e.g. Declination) of the center of the search position specified in decimal degrees.  If a positional/size test query is defined at all, both POS values should be provided. </p>
            <p><b>Test Query (Size)</b>: For a test query wherein your service will return a non-empty response: The diameter of a search specified in decimal degrees.  If a positional/size test query is defined at all, both POS values should be provided; SIZE is optional. </p>
            <p><b>Test Query Data Command</b>:  Fully specified queryData test query formatted as an URL argument list in the syntax specified by the SSA standard.  The list must exclude the REQUEST argument which is assumed to be set to "queryData".
                                                 VERSION may be included if the test query applies to a specific version of the service protocol. 
                                                If queryDataCmd is used to form a query, Positional and Size test query values are not used; if the test query requires POS and SIZE these should be included directly in queryDataCmd (hence non-positional test queries can be supported). 
                                                This value must be a string in the form of name=value pairs delimited with ampersands.  A query may then be formed by appending to the baseURL the request argument.</p>
            <p><b>Spectral Access Protocol Version Number per Interface</b>: Version number of the SSA Protocol this service uses. Ex: "0.4" or "1.0"'.  Most VO applications accessing a service assume version 1.0 compliance if this value is not provided, 
                        but this is not required behaviour and leaving it blank is not recommended. If the version number is not listed, no default version is implied.</p>
    
            <h3><a name="FieldsForNonStandard">Fields for Non-Standard Interfaces Only</a></h3>
            <p><b>Access URL Type</b>: Type of use expected for the associated access URL. BASE is standard and indicates the service expects that URL with standard arguments appended, and is implied
                                      in standard service access URLs. Access URL Use is chosen from a drop-down representing a controlled vocabulary. </p>
            <p><b>Result MIME Type</b>: The MIME type of a document returned in the HTTP response. Ex: "text/xml". This is also implied in standard service access.</p>
